-HOW TO CREATE GRABBABLE FOOD
Use _BaseGrabbable, drag into scene
Under visuals on _BaseGrabbable, place model (Make sure model has a collider)
Drag model collider (if mesh collider, make into convex) into XR Grab Interactable variable collider list on the _BaseGrabbable
rename new food to desired name
drag new food into Prefab -> Resources -> Grabbables and make sure to save as a variant, not original
Make scriptable object ingredient of the newly created food
Add scriptable object to variant prefab
If the ingredient added is a cooked, cut, or seared version, or a recipe, then turn off kinematic

-HOW TO ALTER "low_poly_food" MATERIALS
Copy low_poly_food material (Every food uses same material)
Move duplicated material into Art -> Material folder
Change color of material

-HOW TO ADD NEW RECIPES
Go to Scripts -> SO -> Recipe
Right click to create 
Hover over Cooking option at the top and select recipe
Drag in required Ingredient SO to IngredientHolder list for desired recipe
Drag in GameObject for completed recipe (visual representation of the final dish after fully cooked) at the top
Add new RecipeSO to HealthyPlateManager.cs recipe list variable

-HOW TO ADD CUTTABLE FOOD
Make two prefabs: Cut prefab and Cuttable prefab (Cut prefab is the cut version of the Cuttable prefab)
Go into prefab of desired cuttable food
Drag cut prefab of the cuttable food into cuttable food prefab
Move the visuals of the cuttable prefab so that that cut prefab has space to spawn
Delete cut prefab once you have reached desired distance between cuttable food and spawn place of cut food

TODO:

if food is not held, start timer for despawn
make spawning and destroying networked
cut needs to have bool that lets scriptable object know it needs to be destroyed
add to _BaseGrabbable cut spawn point script that is used when an object is cut to spawn cut pieces
Make list of all foods and completed recipes in game and get nutritional info

add cooking timer
Give some sort of tutorial or something that gives directions
Show indicator for recipe completed
Network recipe board
Add audio for everything
fix fryer
only kinematic original ingredients, not cooked or cut

#1: create a new empty scene
#2: figure out how to debug log hello when the space button is pressed
#3:  Debug log the name of the children of the game object when space is pressed
#4:link the space button being pressed to playing a particle effect
#5: when you press the space button it turns on and turns off whne pressed again
#6: Create event that is called when you press space and link event to particle effect playing
			PRESS SPACE BUTTON, invokes event, the event turns on or off the particle
