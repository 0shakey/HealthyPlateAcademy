-HOW TO CREATE GRABBABLE FOOD

Under visuals on _BaseGrabbable, place model (Make sure model has a collider)
Drag model collider (if mesh collider, make into convex) into XR Grab Interactable variable collider list on the _BaseGrabbable
rename new food to desired name
drag new food into Prefab -> Resources -> Grabbables and make sure to save as a variant, not original
Make scriptable object ingredient of the newly created food
Add scriptable object to variant prefab

-HOW TO ALTER "low_poly_food" MATERIALS
Copy low_poly_food material (Every food uses same material)

Drag in required Ingredient SO to IngredientHolder list for desired recipe
Drag in GameObject for completed recipe (visual representation of the final dish after fully cooked) at the top

-HOW TO ADD CUTTABLE FOOD
Make two prefabs: Cut prefab and Cuttable prefab (Cut prefab is the cut version of the Cuttable prefab)
Go into prefab of desired cuttable food
Drag cut prefab of the cuttable food into cuttable food prefab
Move the visuals of the cuttable prefab so that that cut prefab has space to spawn
Delete cut prefab once you have reached desired distance between cuttable food and spawn place of cut food

TODO:

if food is not held, start timer for despawn
make spawning and destroying networked
cut needs to have bool that lets scriptable object know it needs to be destroyed
add to _BaseGrabbable cut spawn point script that is used when an object is cut to spawn cut pieces
