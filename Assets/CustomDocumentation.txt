Drag model collider (if mesh collider, make into convex) into XR Grab Interactable variable collider list on the _BaseGrabbable
rename new food to desired name
drag new food into Prefab -> Resources -> Grabbables and make sure to save as a variant, not original
Make scriptable object ingredient of the newly created food
Add scriptable object to variant prefab
If the ingredient added is a cooked, cut, or seared version, or a recipe, then turn off kinematic

-HOW TO ADD CUTTABLE FOOD
Make two prefabs: Cut prefab and Cuttable prefab (Cut prefab is the cut version of the Cuttable prefab)
Go into prefab of desired cuttable food
Drag cut prefab of the cuttable food into cuttable food prefab
Move the visuals of the cuttable prefab so that that cut prefab has space to spawn

	Dictionaries: Has a key and value pair. If you are trying to add something to the dictionary with the same key as something else in the dictionary, key that already exists will have its value replaced with the new one trying to be added
	Recursion: Runs through a method several times and returns a value each time; Ex. Adds numbers together and at the end, adds all the numbers together
	Stacks: The last thing you put in, is the first thing you can take out. You can pop something out and get the value; Ex. Debug.Log(exampleStack.Pop()); You can peek which gives you the value of the last thing you put in
	Queues; The first thing you put in is the first thing you can take out. Works pretty much the same as a Stack 
	List: You can infinitely add to them and they use indecies to identify a specific position in the list to get a value from
	Arrays: Have a set length and uses indecies to indentify a specific position in the array to get a value from
	Hashsets: You can infinitely add to them but cannot have any duplicates. Does not use indecies to get a value from. Instead of using a for loop, uses foreach loop
